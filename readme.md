# Data Structures in C++

Welcome to my **Data Structures** repository!  
This repo contains implementations of various fundamental data structures in C++ that I have learned, practiced, and continue to improve.

---

## 📚 What’s Inside

- Singly Linked List  
- (Coming soon: Doubly Linked List, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.)

Each data structure implementation includes:

- Core operations (insertion, deletion, traversal, search, etc.)  
- Common algorithms (sorting, reversing, etc.) where applicable  
- Example usage and testing in main functions

---

## 🚀 Current Implementation

### Singly Linked List

- Insertion (head, tail, arbitrary position)  
- Deletion (head, tail, arbitrary position)  
- Access by index  
- Sorting the list  
- Recursive reverse printing  
- Destructor for safe memory cleanup
