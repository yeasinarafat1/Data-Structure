# Linked Lists Collection

This folder contains my implementations and practice codes for **Linked Lists** as part of the Data Structures repository.

## 📂 What’s Included Here

- **Singly Linked List**

  - Insertions (head, tail, arbitrary position)
  - Deletions (head, tail, arbitrary position)
  - Traversal and element access
  - Sorting
  - Recursive reverse printing
  - Memory management with destructor

- (Planned)
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List

## 📖 Overview

Linked Lists are a fundamental dynamic data structure consisting of nodes linked sequentially.  
This collection covers basic operations and algorithms to deepen understanding and prepare for advanced data structures and algorithm problems.

## 🛠️ How to Run

Each linked list implementation contains a `main()` function demonstrating usage.  
To compile and run, use:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```
